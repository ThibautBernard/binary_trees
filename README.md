# Binary Trees
## General 
* What is a binary tree, binary search tree, AVL, Max Binary Heap
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Practice
* Binary Tree
  * Insert left
  * Insert right
  * Delete entire tree
  * Check if node is leaf
  * Check node is root
  * Pre-order traversal
  * In-order traversal
  * Post-order traversal
  * Get the height
  * Get the depth
  * Get the size
  * Count the leaves of a binary tree
  * Count nodes with at least one child
  * Get the balance factor
  * Check if binary tree is full
  * Check if binary tree is perfect
  * Find sibling
  * Find uncle
  * Lowest common ancestor
  * Level-order traversal
  * Check if binary tree is complete
  * Rotate left
  * Rotate right
  * Check if binary tree is BST
* Binary search tree
  * Insert node
  * Convert array (non order) into BST
  * Search node
  * Remove
  * Big O
